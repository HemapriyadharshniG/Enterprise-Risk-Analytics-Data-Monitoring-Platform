# Enterprise-Risk-Analytics-Data-Monitoring-Platform
📌 Project Overview

This project implements an enterprise-style Data & Analytics platform designed to monitor operational performance and assess risk levels across departments.
It integrates cleaned operational and risk data, applies analytics-ready data modeling, and enables risk-driven decision making, similar to real-world EY GDS consulting engagements.

The solution demonstrates Data Engineering, Analytics, Technology Risk, and SDLC best practices.

🎯 Business Problem

Organizations often face challenges such as:
	•	Siloed operational and risk data
	•	Manual and delayed reporting
	•	Limited visibility into enterprise-wide risks
	•	Reactive rather than proactive risk management

This project addresses these challenges by:
	•	Centralizing operational and risk data
	•	Structuring analytics-ready datasets
	•	Supporting department-wise and time-based risk analysis

⸻

🗂️ Dataset Description

The final dataset is a preprocessed and cleaned CSV file containing 91,626 enterprise records with the following attributes:
	•	dept_id
	•	dept_name
	•	date
	•	month
	•	transactions
	•	errors
	•	delay_minutes
	•	error_rate
	•	event_id
	•	risk_type
	•	severity
	•	severity_score
	•	high_risk_flag (0 / 1)

🏗️ SOLUTION ARCHITECTURE

Preprocessed CSV Data
        ↓
MySQL Workbench
        ↓
Risk Analytics Table (Structured Schema)
        ↓
SQL-Based Analytics & Reporting

This architecture mirrors a typical consulting data pipeline used in Data & Analytics and Technology Risk projects.

🧱 Database Design

The database was designed using a single consolidated analytics table to support efficient querying and reporting on operational and risk data. Since the dataset was already preprocessed and cleaned, a denormalized structure was intentionally chosen to simplify analytics and reduce join complexity.

Table Name: risk_analytics

Design Rationale:
	•	Supports analytics-ready querying without additional joins
	•	Suitable for reporting, dashboards, and risk analysis
	•	Aligns with Data & Analytics consulting use cases
	•	Ensures data integrity and governance through constraints

⸻

Schema Overview

The table captures operational metrics, risk attributes, and derived indicators such as error rates and risk flags.

Key Attributes Include:
	•	Department identifiers and names
	•	Date and month for time-based analysis
	•	Operational metrics (transactions, errors, delays)
	•	Risk event details and severity information
	•	Derived risk indicators (severity score, high-risk flag)

⸻

Keys & Constraints
	•	Composite Primary Key: Ensures record-level uniqueness across department, date, and risk event.
	•	Validation Constraints: Applied on numeric and categorical fields to maintain data quality.
	•	Risk Flags: Binary indicators (0/1) to support filtering of high-risk scenarios.

These controls support Technology Risk and data governance standards.

Data Ingestion Strategy

Data was ingested using MySQL Workbench – Table Data Import Wizard, which is optimized for bulk loading of structured CSV files.

Ingestion Steps:
	1.	Selected the preprocessed CSV file as the data source
	2.	Mapped CSV columns to the database schema
	3.	Performed bulk data load into the risk_analytics table
	4.	Verified successful ingestion through record count and data validation queries

⸻

Data Volume
	•	Total Records Loaded: 91,626+
	•	Format: CSV
	•	Load Type: Bulk import

The import completed successfully and was validated for accuracy and completeness.

⸻

Post-Load Validation

After ingestion, validation checks were performed to ensure:
	•	Correct total record count
	•	Successful enforcement of primary keys and constraints
	•	Accuracy of derived metrics such as error rate and risk flags

This step aligns with the testing and validation phase of the SDLC.

	•	Mirrors real-world enterprise analytics models
	•	Supports Data & Analytics and Technology Risk engagements
	•	Scales for larger datasets
	•	Enables faster insights for business stakeholders
